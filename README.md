# GM_Image_Processing
Image Processing implementation in gml for GMS 1.4

There is a right way todo something, but sometimes you do it because you can.  Here is a small project that does just that.

Have you ever wanted to take a .png image convert it to "gray scale" and then see that said image side by each and look at some pixel data?  Well if your answer is a resounding NO then congragulations sir you are on the right track.  In this example i take a simple .png sample it to a surface using a buffer, smash that buffer into an array (apply filter here) and then puke le ol array back onto a surface for viewing purposes.  Enjoy!
